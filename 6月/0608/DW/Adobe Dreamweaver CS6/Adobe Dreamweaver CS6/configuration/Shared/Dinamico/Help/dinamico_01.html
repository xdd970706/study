<h1>Site-Specific Code Hints</h1>
<p>Using the Site-Specific Code Hints interface you can create the configuration file needed to display code hints when working in Code View of Dreamweaver.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong><em>: The code hints are created specifically for the site  selected in the Dreamweaver Files panel. In order for the code hints to display,  the page you are working on must be saved to the currently selected site.</em></p>
<ol>
  <li>To open the Site-Specific Code Hints interface, select Site &gt; Site-Specific Code Hints.<p>
  When first opened, the Site-Specific Code Hints dialog will scan your site to determine the framework that is being used. Dreamweaver includes 3 predefined frameworks that you can work with, Drupal, Joomla, and Wordpress.</p></li>
  <li>Specify the sub-root where your particular framework's files are stored.</li>
  <li>Choose the Add option to select a file or folder to be added to the scan. Within the <a href="dinamico_04.html">Add Files/Folders interface</a>, you will have the opportunity to select the file extensions to be included.</li>
  <li>Choose the Remove option if you wish to remove the selected files/folders from the scan. <p>
  <strong><em>Note</em></strong><em>: If Drupal or Joomla is selected from the Structure menu, there will be an additional path included to a file within your Dreamweaver configuration folder. This is required when using these frameworks.</em></p></li>
  <li>To change how the Site-Specific Code Hints dialog treats a particular file/folder, select it from the list and do one of the following:
    
  <ul type="square">
    <li type="square"><strong>Scan this folder</strong> Select this option to have the selected directory included in the scan.
      </li>
    <li type="square"><strong>Recursive</strong> Will have all files and folders within the selected directory included in the scan.</li>
    <li type="square"><strong>Extensions</strong> Loads the <a href="dinamico_05.html">Find Extensions</a> dialog where you can view/edit any of the extensions included in your site structure.</li>
    </ul></li>
</ol>

    <p>The four buttons at the top of the dialog allow you to do the following.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Import</strong> Launches the import structure dialog for you to select a .config or XML file to use.</li>
      <li><strong>Save</strong> Launches the <a href="dinamico_02.html">Save Structure Settings</a> dialog.</li>
      <li><strong>Rename</strong> Launches the <a href="dinamico_03.html">Rename Structure Settings</a> dialog.</li>
      <li><strong>Delete</strong> Deletes the selected structure.
      <p>    
      <strong><em>Note</em></strong><em>: The default structures cannot be deleted.</em></li></ul>
